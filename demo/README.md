## Demo notes

[sql_demo.ipynb](demo/sql_demo.ipynb), [llama_demo.ipynb](demo/llama_demo.ipynb), and [langchain_demo.ipynb](demo/langchain_demo.ipynb) assume you followed the instructions in the quickstart to run a containerized instance of IRIS on your computer. 

In order to run an iris container in a notebook (eg. If you're using colab), refer to [iris_notebook_container.ipynb](demo/iris_notebook_container.ipynb). 

For more details on our vector SQl syntax, refer to [SQLSyntax.md](demo/SQLSyntax.md)
